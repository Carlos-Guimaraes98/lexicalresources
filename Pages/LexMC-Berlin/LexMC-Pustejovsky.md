### The Role of Semantics in Lexical Data Modeling

In this class, I discuss the methodology at play when designing or identifying the conceptual inventory that lexicographers use when analyzing the meaning of a specific language domain along with its associated corpora. I address the importance of lexical semantic modeling in creating a coherent abstraction of a linguistic phenomenon. I will use two use cases that demonstrate the interplay between semantic analysis and corpus data when working towards defining a data model, namely the domains of temporal and spatial semantic modeling.
